					<h4>About Me</h4>
					<p>I'm a senior software developer with a strong Python emphasis and expertise in building scalable web applications.  I have a proven ability to quickly master new technologies, honed through experience as a bootcamp instructor.  I'm passionate about solving hard back-end problems and a strong proponent of clean, maintainable code, robust automated testing, and efficient developer tooling.</p>
					<h4>Projects</h4>
					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="https://github.com/madjaqk/microblog_with_microservices">Microblog With Microservices</a></h5>
						<p>A microblogging platform I built to explore service-oriented architecture, featuring distinct FastAPI services for user, post, and feed management.  Services communicate asynchronously with Redis streams and are orchestrated using Docker Compose.  This also includes a statically-served React/Next.js front-end and JWT-based user authentication.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, React/Next.js, Redis, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, HTML5</p>

					</div>
					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="https://assets.enthought.com">Enthought Assets Server</a></h5>
						<p>A Django app to allow Enthought staff to upload installers and documentation files and make them accessible to users with the correct permissions.  Under the hood, it interacts with a Keycloak server for user authentication and was built using Docker containers to automate deployment.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: Python, Django, AWS/boto3, Keycloak, Docker Stack, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="https://cryptics.jackbrounstein.com">Cryptic Contests</a></h5>
						<p>A website for running contests for writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crossword</a> clues, used by my friends in the puzzle community.  It uses Celery and RabbitMQ to automatically close contests after a certain amount of time as well as webhooks to push contest notifications to Discord.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: Python, Django, RabbitMQ/Celery, OAuth, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3</p>

					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="http://puzzles.jackbrounstein.com">Puzzle Master</a></h5>
						<p>A Django app to host metapuzzles online, with social log-in, answer tracking and validation and a PostgreSQL database, as well as a set of example puzzles inspired by (but significantly easier than) the MIT Mystery Hunt.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: Python, Django, OAuth, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3</p>

					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="http://tiles.jackbrounstein.com">Tile Game</a></h5>
						<p>A web game that that involves rearranging letters to form words.  It's fun!  The game uses the SOWPODS word list (the same as international Scrabble), converted into a JSON listing all legal words and their scores.  That process was done using a combination of terminal commands (mostly <code>grep</code> and <code>comm</code>) and a simple Python script.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: Angular.js, Express, Node.js, jQuery UI, HTML5, CSS3</p>

					</div>
					<div class="project-box">
						<h5><a href="/Set/">Set</a></h5>
						<p>Implementation of the card game Set.  Written in under 16 hours for a Coding Dojo hackathon, where it earned first place.</p>
						<p class="techs">Technologies used: JavaScript, jQuery, SVG, HTML5, CSS3</p>

					<h4>Anything Else?</h4>
					<p><a href="/project_ideas">Random project idea generator</a></p>
					<p>While with Coding Dojo, I wrote up explanations of some tricky beginner-level programming concepts for students, a <a href="https://github.com/madjaqk/explanations/blob/master/lambda.md">guide to lambda functions in Python</a> and a (non-technical) <a href="https://github.com/madjaqk/explanations/blob/master/big_O.md">introduction to Big O notation</a>.</p>
					<p>I was part of season one of my friend Eric's podcast "Do It In 12", where people set goals to accomplish within three months.  I tried to write a novel, though it ended up somewhere between a short novella and a long short story.  It's called <em>Yesteryear</em>, and it's about time travel and also working in an office; you can find a PDF <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_9TmamD1-vZX3hna19zNnktWjg/view">here</a>.
